content: "I'm Nancy, currently living in South Korea. Since 2019, I've been working on tech projects that offer services like drone data processing, voice cloning, and educational platform services. Learning the art of coding can be both extremely rewarding and frustrating. And I wanted to capture those moments, both the good and the bad, before they fade away from my memories. Hence this blog."
